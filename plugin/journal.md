Right now:

- ARCore session runs
- feed is displayed
- camera pose is driven
- depth use is disabled due to division of the godot's MR (API to be reworked)
- planes are created (both vertical and horizontal)

TODO:

- shrink planes size when needed
- handle phone orientation
- handle light estimation
- handle point cloud rendering
- make a small but nice demo
- make it at run a minimal code on windows (for now it crashes at startup)
